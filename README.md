# BIO465LeafPrediction
Code necessary to predict plant-disease pair based on image of leaf.

Image(s) to be predicted need to be placed inside the ```images```
folder. Also the ```classify.py``` script needs to be modified to point the script to the new image as of right now.

All requirements for Caffe should be installed (requirements.txt is included inside ```caffe/distribute/python```)

Another possibilty is to use one of the Dockers defined in ```caffe/docker```)
